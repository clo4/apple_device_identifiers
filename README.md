# apple_device_identifiers

[Structure](#structure) • [Usage](#usage) • [Sources](#sources--resources) •
[Contributing](#contributing) • [License](#license)

A best-effort compilation of Apple's device identifiers, starting from the late
2000s. Everything in this repository is public domain (see
[UNLICENSE](./UNLICENSE)), so you can vendor any files you need without having
to give credit.

If you notice something wrong or missing, please open an issue!

## Structure

### devices/*.json

These files contain the mappings of name to ID. They're manually curated.

### devices.json, ids.json

Generated JSON files containing all the data from the JSON files above.

### mod.ts

A generated TypeScript module that makes it easy to use this data from Deno.

### build.ts

A Deno script that builds devices.json and mod.ts using the data in the devices
directory. See [#contributing](#contributing).

## Usage

As this project is public domain, you can vendor the JSON files you need, or
request them from githubusercontent. No crediting is required, no license to add
to a giant list.

---

There's also a TypeScript module generated for Deno. Because this repository is
not versioned, you must always pin to a specific commit hash.

<sub><b>deps/devices.ts</b></sub>

```javascript
export * from "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SeparateRecords/apple_device_identifiers/<COMMIT>/mod.ts";
```

<sub><b>mod.ts</b></sub>

```typescript
import { devices, Identifier } from "./deps/devices.ts";

const id: Identifier = devices["iPad mini 3"];
```

Libraries should use `AnyIdentifier` instead of `Identifier` to allow any string
to be assigned, while still providing suggestions.
**[Read the documentation][docs]** for information on the exported value and
types.

## Sources & Resources

To the best of my knowledge, there's no official list of identifiers, and even
the products themselves don't always have canonical names. As a result, the data
in this repository had to be gathered from a variety of sources.

- **https://everymac.com** - a pretty good compilation, but the website is slow
  and can't be used in code.
- **https://www.theiphonewiki.com** - a great resource to reference for mobile
  devices.
- **https://github.com/blacktop/ipsw** -
  [this page](https://blacktop.github.io/ipsw/docs/commands/device-list/) in the
  docs has IDs, but not all of them have descriptive product names.
- **[This Gist by @adamawolf](https://gist.github.com/adamawolf/3048717)** -
  lists most mobile devices.
- **[Geekbench Browser](https://browser.geekbench.com)** - when new devices are
  released, reviewers tend to upload their scores.
- **Xcode database files** - Xcode includes databases of device traits
  ([see below](#list-device_traitsdb-files))
- **Apple's "Identify your device" pages** - Mac pages have identifiers, but
  they're not consistent.
- **Various threads on Reddit** - thanks, kind internet strangers!

### List device_traits.db files

These can be opened using the sqlite3 CLI, or a GUI like
[DB Browser for SQLite](https://sqlitebrowser.org/). The table of interest is
`devices`.

```bash
find /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms -name 'device_traits.db' 2>/dev/null
```

## Contributing

Always run the `build` task before committing, or use `watch` while making
changes.

```bash
deno task build  # generate files
deno task watch  # watch for changes
```

To add a new class of devices, just add a new JSON file to the
[devices](devices) folder.

## License

Since I'm probably not the only one who needs this, I'm releasing this to the
public domain.
